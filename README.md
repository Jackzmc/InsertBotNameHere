InsertBotNameHere is a discord.js bot for your server, which can do moderation, utility commands, fun commands, and many more. You can even add user-submitted, (staff-approved) commands!
 
## Okay, how do I get started? ##
First off, add the bot to your server: [Add to my server](https://jackz.me/add-to-server)
Second, the bot will send you a message on how to set it up. Follow those steps, if you need support join our support server at [link to be filled](#). If you want information how to use advanced features either look at #faq on the server or check the wiki here on github.

## I have a suggestion! ##
That's great! All suggestions go into #suggestions on discord, or as an issue on github


# So, where's the code? #
InsertBotNameHere is not open-source project, but if you want an open-source (crappy, keep in mind) bot that you can customize and host yourself try [JackzCo](https://github.com/Jackzmc/JackzCo-Bot)
